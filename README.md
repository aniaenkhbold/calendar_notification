The purpose of this program is to utilize the free trials of twilio messaging API and Google Calendar API
to create a program that sends daily automated messages to the user. The message contains the user's
schedule for the day stored in their Google Calendar. This specific code only works with Ariunzaya's google
calendar and phone number but it can be further enhanced to be compatible with any user who grants access
and authentication.
